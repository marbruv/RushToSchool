# RushToSchool

Rush to School is a fast-paced 2D cycling action game where players must race against time to reach school before the teacher loses their patience. The player rides through chaotic urban streets filled with traffic, pedestrians, scooters and potholes. Quick reflexes, strategic use of power-ups, and time management are key to success. The game combines humor, everyday relatability, and arcade-style challenge to create a fun and replayable experience.

Suitable for WASD, arrows and joystick.
